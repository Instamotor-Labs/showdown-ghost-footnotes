Here is a footnote reference,[^longnote] and another.[^1]

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

   Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
   belong to the previous footnote.

       { some.code }

   The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
   line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
   multi-paragraph list items.

   [^1]: Here is the footnote indented.


This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it
isn't indented.
